        public function dashBoard(NeoxDashSetupRepository $setupRepository): Response
        {
            /*
             * Get the first setup
             * so if you want to add security by user you can do it here
             * in your entity add join with user <=> NeoxDashsetup
             * render your dashboard with user current
             * $NeoxDashSetup = user->getNeoxDashSetup()......
             */
             
            $NeoxDashSetup = $setupRepository->findOneBy(["id"=>1]);
            return $this->render('neox_dashboard_bundle/index.html.twig', [
                'NeoxDashSetup' => $NeoxDashSetup,
                ......
            ]);
        }

    ....
    
      <div id="NeoxDashBoardBundle">
          {{ include('@NeoxDashBoardBundle/index.html.twig') }}
      </div>
  
    ....
````
